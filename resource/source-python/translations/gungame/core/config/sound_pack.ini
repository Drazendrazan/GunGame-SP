en = """winner_sounds.txt -- Random winner sound file definitions.

In the chosen soundpack file, "winner" MUST be set to
   "winner_sounds.txt" for this to work.

All files are relative to "../cstrike/sound/".

Example: gungame/winner.mp3 would be ../cstrike/sound/gungame/winner.mp3
         on the server.

Note: Any alteration of this file requires a server restart
      or a reload of GunGame."""
